### Naming conventions for student repositories

When creating an assignment in GitHub Classrooms, use a prefix for the module and year. For example, for Web Development and User Experience in academic year 2022-23, for an HTML contact form, the assignment name might be `wdux2223-assignment-name`. This will result in student repositories with that as a prefix.
