# Birkbeck School of Creative Arts, Culture and Communication

Welcome!

This GitHub organization (`Birkbeck2`) is used to house teaching and learning repositories for several modules in Birkbeck's Digital Media Design programme.

## Getting started

Are you new to GitHub? You may find what you need in the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/).

## Module repositories

* [Web Development and User Experience (Autumn)](https://github.com/Birkbeck2/web-development)
* [Visual Design and Web Project (Spring)](https://github.com/Birkbeck2/web-project)

## Your repositories

To search a list of the `Birkbeck2` repositories that you have access to, go to [Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Birkbeck2/repositories). Note you may also have repositories on your personal account--that's a separate list.

## For lecturers

### Naming conventions for student repositories

When creating an assignment in GitHub Classrooms, use a prefix matching the module name so that it is easier to search and filter them.

For example, for Web Development and User Experience, the repository name is `web-development`. For an HTML contact form assignment, you might name the assignment `web-development-contact-form`. This will result in student repositories with that as a prefix, such as `web-development-contact-form-joemull`.
