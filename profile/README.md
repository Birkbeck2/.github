# Birkbeck School of Creative Arts, Culture and Communication

Welcome!

This GitHub organization (`Birkbeck2`) is used to house teaching and learning repositories for several modules in Birkbeck's Digital Media Design programme.

To search a list of the `Birkbeck2` repositories that you have access to, go to [Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Birkbeck2/repositories). Note you may also have repositories on your personal account--that's a separate list.

## For lecturers

### Naming conventions for student repositories

When creating an assignment in GitHub Classrooms, use a prefix for the module and year. For example, for Web Development and User Experience in academic year 2022-23, the assignment name might be `wdux2223-assignment-name`. This will result in student repositories with that as a prefix. So for an assignment to make an HTML contact form, name the assignment `wdux2223-contact-form`, and the student repository for GitHub username `joemull` will be `wdux2223-contact-form-joemull`.
